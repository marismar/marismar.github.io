Welcome to my blog!

I’m Marismar Landim, a Software Engineer passionate about crafting efficient and scalable solutions. With experience in building mobile and web applications, I thrive on solving complex problems using modern tools and technologies like Flutter, Kotlin, Rust, and TypeScript. I’m also a firm believer in clean code, robust testing, and leveraging data-driven practices for impactful development.

When I’m not working on cutting-edge projects at XP Inc., you’ll find me exploring algorithm challenges, contributing to developer communities, or diving into new tech trends.

Here, I aim to share practical solutions and insights from tackling algorithmic challenges on LeetCode. Whether you're a fellow developer preparing for coding interviews or looking to enhance your problem-solving skills, this space is dedicated to breaking down problems, exploring various approaches, and optimizing for real-world scenarios.

Join me as we turn challenges into opportunities to learn, grow, and code better.
